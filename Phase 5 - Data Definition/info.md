## Overview of the Fifth iTelos Phase

The fifth phase presented a significant challenge: mastering the use of the **Karma tool**. While we found its interface to be less intuitive and user-friendly at times, and some processes somewhat tedious, we recognize the value of its output for our project.

### Key Activities
1. **Karma Tool Mastery**: We dedicated time to learning and navigating the Karma tool, despite its steep learning curve.
2. **Dataset Review and Fixing**: All team members contributed to reviewing and fixing datasets as needed to ensure compatibility with Karma.
3. **Mapping Operations**: We carried out mapping operations in Karma, aligning our datasets with the project's schema.
