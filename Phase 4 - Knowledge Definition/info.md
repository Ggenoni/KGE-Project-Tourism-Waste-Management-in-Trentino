## Overview of the Fourth iTelos Phase

The fourth phase, along with the first, was one of the most conceptually challenging stages of the project. It required us to think about the structure of our schema at a higher level of abstraction, moving beyond the **Entity-Relationship (ER) model**. This deeper reflection led to the development of the **Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) model** and the addition of new terms to our domain language.

### Key Activities
1. **Schema Abstraction**: We analyzed the schema at a higher conceptual level, refining its structure to better align with our project goals.
2. **EER Model Development**: Building on the ER model, we developed the **EER model** to capture more complex relationships and constraints.
3. **Teleontology and Teleology Development**: Using **Protégé**, we implemented teleontology and teleology, leveraging the tool's functionality for future scalability.
4. **Competency Question Revision**: We revisited and revised our competency questions to ensure full alignment with the updated schema. This remains an ongoing priority, as further adjustments are likely as the project progresses.
