## Overview of the Third iTelos Phase

In this phase, each team member focused on defining the concepts primarily associated with the datasets curated during the second phase. We collaborated to resolve ambiguities and reach a consensus on more complex definitions.

### Key Activities
1. **Concept Definition**: Each team member worked on defining concepts related to their respective datasets.
2. **Collaborative Refinement**: We held discussions to resolve ambiguities and align on complex definitions.
3. **ER Model Refinement**: Led by **Yishak**, we revisited and refined the **Entity-Relationship (ER) model** to clearly identify key terms based on the data resources gathered in the second phase.
4. **Report Revision**: In response to feedback from our tutor, we added a new section on **knowledge and language resources** to the second phase report.
