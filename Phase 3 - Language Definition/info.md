\subsection{Overview of the third iTelos phase}
In this phase, each team member focused on defining the concepts primarily associated with the databases curated during the second phase. However, we worked together to resolve any ambiguities and reach a consensus on more complex definitions. This phase also required us to revisit and refine the ER model, a task led by Yishak, in order to clearly identify the key terms to prioritize, based on the data resources and databases gathered in the second phase. Finally, we revised the second phase report, specifically by adding a section on knowledge and language resources, in response to feedback from our tutor.
